This tool currently has two functions:
  - Export data from the Pure API in a format that can be read by the bulk importer. 
  - Optional modification of the exported data using XHTML. 

## For developers

Clone or fork the PureExporter code as you see fit. The solution contains two projects; the PureExporter project itself and an installer project to creat setup files. There are currently four dependencies (.NET framework, Mvp.Xml, Newtonsoft.Json and Restsharp) that should be automatically picked up by Visual Studio. 

## For end users 

Download the latest installer provided [here](https://github.com/CopyCat73/Pure-Dev/blob/master/Pure%20Exporter%20Installer.zip). Unzip and run setup.exe to start the install. 

Please refer to the installation readme for further instructions.
