After unzipping the installer files to a folder, run setup.exe. You will be greeted by the welcome screen:

Click close to finish the setup.

Run the PureExporter from your installed location. When you run the application for the first time, the API connection needs to be setup:

After clicking ok you will be taken to the setup tab. You will need an api key to retrieve data from the api. To do this, go into the admin tab of Pure and create an api key for the application. An all access admin key works best, but use at your own risk. The application cannot write any information into Pure, but an admin key gives the application access to confidential information.

Go back to the application. You should see the settings tab.
On this tab enter the url to your *new* api. Make sure to use "https" and put a trailing slash at the end. Enter your current api version (if you dont know which one: type https://yoururltopure/ws in the browser and your current api version will be shown). Next enter the api key you created in the key field.

Click save and if the api setup is correct, the status bar at the top should say "connected".
